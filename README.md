Sacchon is a diabetes management web application designed to help people with diabetes manage their condition more effectively. It consists of two distinct subsystems, the Sacchon REST-API (BackEnd) and the Sacchon Angular App (FrontEnd).
The app allows patients to keep track of their blood glucose level, their daily consumed carbohydrates as well as their medication intake. 
Furthermore, Sacchon aims to assist doctors by offering them the ability to provide advice to patients on a per-call basis. 
Lastly, our diabetes management web application can provide reporting services equiped with tables and charts.
